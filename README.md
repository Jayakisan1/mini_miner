An amazing challenge https://hackattic.com/

In BItcoin, it has field called nonce. So while mining, The hashed value should have some initials. This nonce value is set in such a way that we can achieve this initials. 

I used js to find the value of nonce. Its simple, I started from 0 and increased it by 1. If we get the required initials then "BOOM". Pretty simple!!!!
